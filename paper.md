# Summary

A 3D Slicer [@Fedorov2012] extension for ultrasound image formation,
processing, and analysis. Interfaces are built off the ITKUltrasound library
[@McCormick2014]. The modules available in this extension are useful for both
2D and 3D image generation for traditional B-mode imaging [@McCormick2010],
but also next-generation ultrasound image modalities like ultrasound
spectroscopy [@Aylward2016], acoustic radiation force imaging (ARFI)
[@Palmeri2016], acoustic radiation force shear wave imaging (ARFI-SWEI)
[@Rosenzweig2014], and others.
